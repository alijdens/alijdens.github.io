# Minimax animations

Thi directory contains an implementation that shows a step-by-step animation of the minimax variations used to solve Three Mens Morris. It builds into a static app that can be embedded into a website.

## Compile

```shell
make build
```

and that will bundle the app and replace the static files in the [`assets`](../../../assets/three-mens-morris/examples) directory.
